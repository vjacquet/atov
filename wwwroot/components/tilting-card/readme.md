Tilting card web component
==========================

Based on Kevin Powell's [Create a tilting card on hover with CSS only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOJTj_mWJds).

Eventhough the plain CSS approach  explained by Kevin is nice, I am not found of adding markup solely for CSS tricks. So I attempted to hide
the generation of the `<div>`s in a web component.

One of the issue with the plain CSS approach is that the grid is over the panel and prevent interaction. The "mostly js" variant is a fix for this issue.

> **Note**  
> Investigate upgrading the grid for a smoother experience.
