Animate Text web component
==========================

Based on Adam Argyle's [split text](https://github.com/argyleink/gui-challenges/tree/main/split-text) _GUI Challenges_.

I combined the `split-by` and `xxx-animation` attributes into the `animation` attribute because the styling is dependent on both.

The `algorithms` and `animations` can be extended.
